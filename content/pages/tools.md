You will need to install SQL Server 2008 Express with Management Tools, which includes the SQL Server database engine and SQL Server Management Studio Basic. You can download both these software packages from the above site.

_September 2020 Update_:Â This course was originally developed using Microsoft SQL Server JDBC Driver 3.0 which is no longer supported by Microsoft. {{% resource_link "f28d0a64-83b5-41f0-be4c-d6c4122b38d9" "This page" %}} contains all the currently supported JDBC drivers.
