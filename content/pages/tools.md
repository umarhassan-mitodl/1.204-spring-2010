See the installation instructions in [_6.092 Introduction to Programming in Java_](/courses/6-092-introduction-to-programming-in-java-january-iap-2010/pages/syllabus).

We will use Visual Paradigm in the database section of the course. You are also encouraged to use its class diagram feature when doing your homework, but it is not required.

Click the "Get a Free Community Edition" button in the top right.

SQL Server 2008 Express
-----------------------

We will use SQL Server in the database section of the course, and for homework after that as well.

[Microsoft SQL Server 2008 Express Edition](http://www.microsoft.com/express/Database/)

You will need to install SQL Server 2008 Express with Management Tools, which includes the SQL Server database engine and SQL Server Management Studio Basic. You can download both these software packages from the above site.

_September 2020 Update_:Â This course was originally developed using Microsoft SQL Server JDBC Driver 3.0 which is no longer supported by Microsoft. [This page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/connect/jdbc/download-microsoft-jdbc-driver-for-sql-server?view=sql-server-ver15) contains all the currently supported JDBC drivers.
